# Data Science Process

## Workflow
```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/AnalysisProcessBaumer.jpg")
```


## Stitch Fix

Example of how data and algorithms are used to make decisions.

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/SFalg.jpg")
```


http://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/


## What can/can't statistics & data science do?

* Can model the data at hand!
* Can find patterns & visualizations in large datasets.
* Can't establish causation (mostly).
* Can't represent data if it isn't there.




## Twitter


In 2013, DiGrazia et al. published a provocative paper suggesting that polling could now be replaced by analyzing social media data.  They analyzed 406 competitive US congressional races using over 3.5 billion tweets.  In an article in *The Washington Post* one of the co-authors, Rojas, writes: "Anyone with programming skills can write a program that will harvest tweets, sort them for content and analyze the results.  This can be done with nothing more than a laptop computer." (Rojas, 2013)


1.  The data come from neither an experiment nor a random sample - there must be careful thought applied to the question of *to whom* the analysis can be generalized.  The data were also scraped from the internet.
2. The analysis was done combining domain knowledge (about congressional races) with a data source that seems completely irrelevant at the outset (tweets).
3. The dataset was quite large!  3.5 billion tweets were collected and a random sample of 500,000 tweets were analyzed.
4. The researchers were from sociology and computer science - a truly collaborative endeavor, and one that is often quite efficient at producing high quality analyses.


## Activity

Spend a few minutes reading the Rojas editorial. Be sure to consider Figure 1 carefully, and address the following questions.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/twitterscatter.jpg") 
#knitr::include_graphics("../images/twitterreg.jpg")
```


## Statistics Hat

1. Discuss Figure 1 with your neighbor. What is its purpose? What does it convey? Think critically about this data visualization. What would you do differently?

2. How would you improve the plot?  I.e., annotate it to make it more convincing / communicative?  Does it need enhancement?

3.  Do you think the study holds water? Why or why not? What are the shortcomings of this study?


## Data Scientist Hat

Imagine that your boss, who does not have advanced technical skills or knowledge, asked you to reproduce the study you just read. Discuss the following with your neighbor.

1. What steps are necessary to reproduce this study? Be as specific as you can! Try to list the subtasks that you would have to perform.

2.  What computational tools would you use for each task?

3. Identify all the steps necessary to conduct the study.  Could you do it given your current abilities \& knowledge?  What about the practical considerations?  




## Advantages

1. Cheap

2. Can measure any political race (not just the wealthy ones).

## Disadvantages

1. Is it really reflective of the voting populace?  Who would it bias toward?

2. Does simple mention of a candidate always reflect voting patterns?  When wouldn't it?

3. Margin of error of 2.7\%.  How is that number typically calculated in a poll?  Note: $2 \cdot \sqrt{(1/2)(1/2)/1000} = 0.0316$.

4. Tweets feel more free in terms of what you are able to say - is that a good thing or a bad thing with respect to polling?

5. Can't measure any demographic information.


## What could be done differently?

* Gelman:  look only at close races

* Gelman: "It might make sense to flip it around and predict twitter mentions given candidate popularity. That is, rotate the graph 90 degrees, and see how much variation there is in tweet shares for elections of different degrees of closeness."

* Gelman: "And scale the size of each dot to the total number of tweets for the two candidates in the election."

* Gelman: Make the data publicly available so that others can try to reproduce the results

# Toolkit: Computing

We use tools to do the things.
But the tools are **not** the things.


# Reproducible data analysis

## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}

::: question
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
:::

**Short-term goals:**

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?
-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

**Long-term goals:**

-   Can the code be used for other data?
-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Toolkit for reproducibility

-   Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto
-   Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

## R and RStudio {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../images/r-logo.png){fig-alt="R logo" fig-align="center"}

-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
-   It's easily extensible with *packages*
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
![](../images/rstudio-logo.png){fig-alt="RStudio logo"}

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
-   RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists

## R packages


-   **Packages**: Fundamental units of reproducible R code, including reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data<sup>1</sup>

-   As of August 26, 2024, there are 21,145 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)<sup>2</sup>

-   We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

## Tour: R + RStudio {.smaller}

## Tour recap: R + RStudio

![](../images/tour-r-rstudio.png)

## A short list (for now) of R essentials

-   Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false

do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

. . .

-   Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

## R essentials (continued)

-   Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false

dataframe$var_name
```

. . .

-   Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

```{r}
#| eval: false

?mean
```

## tidyverse

# Quarto

## Quarto


-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you `Render`, the analysis is run from the beginning
-   Code goes in chunks 
-   Narrative goes outside of chunks


## Tour: Quarto {.smaller}


## Tour recap: Quarto

![](../images/tour-quarto.png){fig-alt="RStudio IDE with a Quarto document, source code on the left and output on the right. Annotated to show the YAML, a link, a header, and a code chunk." fig-align="center"}

## Environments

::: {.callout-important}
The environment of your Quarto document is separate from the Console!
:::

Remember this, and expect it to bite you a few times as you're learning to work with Quarto!

## Environments

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
First, run the following in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

<br>

::: {.question .fragment}
All looks good, eh?
:::
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
Then, add the following in an R chunk in your Quarto document

```{r}
#| eval: false

x * 3
```

<br>

::: {.question .fragment}
What happens?
Why the error?
:::

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every assignment is an Quarto document.
-   You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with.
-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester.

# Toolkit: Version control and collaboration

## Git and GitHub {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../images/git-logo.png){fig-alt="Git logo" fig-align="center" width="150"}

-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../images/github-logo.png){fig-alt="GitHub logo" fig-align="center" width="150"}

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)

## Git and GitHub tips {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.
-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.
-   There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

# Agenda  8/28/24

1. Reproducibility
2. GitHub
3. NSSD

::: {.callout-important}
Before next Tuesday, read: Tufte. 1997. <a href = "http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_textb" target = "_blank">Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions</a>.  (Use Google to find it.)
:::

## Reproducibility

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/reproducibilitysmall.jpg")
```


## Example #1

### Science retracts gay marriage paper without agreement of lead author LaCour

* In May 2015 Science retracted a study of how canvassers can sway people’s opinions about gay marriage published just 5 months prior.

* Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt: 
    + Original survey data not made available for independent reproduction of results. 
    + Survey incentives misrepresented. 
    + Sponsorship statement false.

* Two Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study quickly discovered that the data must have been faked.

* Methods we’ll discuss can’t prevent this, but they can make it easier to discover issues.

Source: http://news.sciencemag.org/policy/2015/05/science-retracts-gay-marriage-paper-without-lead-author-s-consent


## Example #2

### Seizure study retracted after authors realize data got "terribly mixed"

* From the authors of Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in Preterm Neonates:

"The article has been retracted at the request of the authors. After carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical correctness."

Source: http://retractionwatch.com/2013/02/01/seizure-study-retracted-after-authors-realize-data-got-terribly-mixed/


## Example #3


### Bad spreadsheet merge kills depression paper, quick fix resurrects it

* The authors informed the journal that the merge of lab results and other survey data used in the paper resulted in an error regarding the identification codes. Results of the analyses were based on the data set in which this error occurred. Further analyses established the results reported in this manuscript and interpretation of the data are not correct.

* Original conclusion: Lower levels of CSF IL-6 were associated with current depression and with future depression […].

* Revised conclusion: Higher levels of CSF IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with current depression […].

Source: http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/01/bad-spreadsheet-merge-kills-depression-paper-quick-fix-resurrects-it/


## Reproducible data analysis


* Scriptability → R [in contrast to pull down menus]

* Literate programming → R Markdown [in contrast to multiple files]

* Version control → Git / GitHub [in contrast to multiple versions]


 

## Scripting and literate programming

### Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1983)"

"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer- what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings- what we want a computer to do."

* These ideas have been around for years!
* and tools for putting them to practice have also been around
* but they have never been as accessible as the current tools



## Reproducibility checklist


* Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
* Does the code actually do what you think it does?
* In addition to what was done, is it clear why it was done? (e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
* Can the code be used for other data?
* Can you extend the code to do other things?


## Tools: R & R Studio


* You must use both software programs
* R does the programming
* R Studio brings everything together
* You may use Pomona's server: https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu/ (or https://rstudio.pomona.edu if you are off campus)
* See course website for getting started: https://m154-comp-stats.netlify.app/github.html


## R vs R Studio

R: think "python"

R Studio: think "jupyter notebook" or "Google Colab"

```{r fig.cap = "Taken from [Modern Drive: An introduction to statistical and data sciences via R](https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/), by Ismay and Kim", out.width = "800px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/RRstudio.jpg")
```

## R Studio


```{r fig.cap = "[Jessica Ward](https://jkrward.github.io/), PhD student at Newcastle University",out.width = "1000px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/cookingRstudio.jpg")
```

## Tools: GitHub

* You must submit your assignments via GitHub + Gradescope
* Follow Jenny Bryan's advice on how to get set-up: http://happygitwithr.com/
* Follow course specific advice: https://m154-comp-stats.netlify.app/github.html

## Steps for weekly homework


1. You will get a link to the new assignment (clicking on the link will create a new private repo)  
2. Use R Studio  
     + New Project, version control, Git  
     + Clone the repo using SSH  
3. If it exists, rename the Rmd file to ma154-hw#-lname-fname.Rmd  
4. Do the assignment  
     + **commit** and **push** after every problem  
5. All necessary files *must* be in the same folder (e.g., data)  

## Tools: a GitHub merge conflict (demo)


- On GitHub (on the web) edit the README document and Commit it with a message describing what you did.

- Then, in RStudio also edit the README document with a different change.
     + Commit your changes
     + Try to push – you’ll get an error!
     + Try pulling
     + Resolve the merge conflict and then commit and push
 
- As you work in teams you will run into merge conflicts, learning how to resolve them properly will be very important.

## NSSD: 


1. What was Hilary trying to answer in her data collection?

2. Name two of Hilary's main hurdles in gathering accurate data.

3. Which is better:  high touch (manual) or low touch (automatic) data collection?  Why?

4. What additional covariates are needed / desired?  Any problems with them?

5. How much data does she need?
