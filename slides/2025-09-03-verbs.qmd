# Agenda  9/3/25

1. Tidy data
2. Data verbs
3. pivoting
 

# The data


## What does a data set *look like*?

- **Observations** down the rows
- **Variables** across the columns
- Flat file versus relational database.

 

## Active Duty Military

The Active Duty data are not tidy!  What are the cases?  How are the data not tidy?  What might the data look like in tidy form?  Suppose that the case was "an individual in the armed forces."  What variables would you use to capture the information in the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ow6Cm4z-Z1Yybk3i352msulYCEDOUaOghmo9ALajyHo/edit#gid=1811988794" target = "_blank">following table</a>?

```{r out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/activedutyTidy.png")
```

 

## Tidy packages: the tidyverse


```{r fig.cap = "image credit: https://www.tidyverse.org/.", fig.alt = "Image of hex stickers for the eight core tidyverse packages including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats.", preview = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tidyverse.png")
```

 

## Reading in data from a file

Hosted online:

```{r load_from_file, eval = TRUE}
movies <- read.csv("http://pages.pomona.edu/~jsh04747/courses/math58/Math58Data/movies2.csv")
```


```{r}
```


Hosted locally:
```{r load_local, eval = FALSE}
movies <- read_csv("movies2.csv")
```

Things to note:

- The assign arrow is used to create **objects** in R, which are stored in your
environment.
- Object names don't have to correspond to file names.
- Be sure R knows where to look for the file!

 

## Viewing data - the viewer / Environment

- `View()` can be used in RStudio to bring up an excel-style spreadsheet. Only
for viewing, not editing!
- The dimensions of the data are found in the environment pane.
- The names of the variables are seen at the top of the viewer.
- `View()` has a capital letter `V`.
- `View()` should not be used in the Quarto document.

 
## Viewing data - inside .qmd / the console

- `dim()` is used to find the dimensions (rows x columns).
- `names()` is used to find the names of the variables.
- `head()` is used to print the first several lines of the dataset to the console.


## Practice 

1. What are the dimensions of the data set?
2. What are the variables?
3. What appears to be the unit of observation?


```{r eval = TRUE}
dim(movies)
names(movies)
head(movies,3)
```

 
## Reading in data from a package

For now, we'll work with all flights out of the three NYC airports in 2013.

1. Download and install the package from CRAN (done in the Console, only once).
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("nycflights13")
```
2. Load the package (in the .qmd file, need it for the .qmd file to compile appropriately).
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```
3. Make the data set visible.
```{r}
data(flights)
```
4. Get help.
```{r}
#| eval: false
?flights
```

 

# Slice and dice with dplyr (a package within the tidyverse)

## **dplyr**

> Whenever you're learning a new tool, for a long time you're going to suck ...
> but the good news is that is typical, that's something that happens to everyone, 
> and it's only temporary.

-Hadley Wickham

 

## Why dplyr?

Data sets are often of high *volume* (lots of rows) and high *variety* (lots of columns). This is overwhelming to visualize and analyze, so we find ourselves chopping the data set up into more manageable and meaningful chunks. We also  often need to perform operations to organize and clean our data.

This is all possible in base R, but with `dplyr`, it is simple, readable, and fast.

# Verbs

Most data wrangling happens with a set of data verbs.  Verbs are **functions** that act on data frames.  

The first argument of each data verb is the data frame.

## Some Basic Verbs

- `filter()`
- `arrange()`
- `select()`
- `mutate()`
- `summarize()`
- `group_by()`
 

## `filter()`

Allows you to select a subset of the **rows** of a data frame. The first
argument is the name of the data frame, the following arguments are the
filters that you'd like to apply

For all flights on January 1st:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

 

## Constructing filters

Filters are constructed of **logical operators**: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`,
`!=` (and some others).

Adding them one by one to `filter()` is akin to saying "this AND that". To say
"this OR that OR both", use |.

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1 | month == 2)
```

 
## Practice

Construct filters to isolate:

1. Flights that left on St. Patrick's Day.
2. Flights that were destined for Chicago's primary airport.
3. Flights that were destined for Chicago's primary airport and were operated by United Airlines.
4. Flights with flight times more than 2000 miles or that were in the air more than 5 hours.

 
## Solution

1. Flights that left on St. Patrick's Day.
2. Flights that were destined for Chicago's primary airport.
3. Flights that were destined for Chicago's primary airport and were operated by
United Airlines.
4. Flights with flight times more than 2000 miles or that were in the air more
than 5 hours.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 3, day == 17)
filter(flights, dest == "ORD")
filter(flights, dest == "ORD", carrier == "UA")
filter(flights, distance > 2000 | air_time > 5*60)
```

 

## `arrange()`

`arrange()` reorders the rows: It takes a data frame, and a set of column 
names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than 
one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values
of preceding columns:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

Use `desc()` to sort in descending order.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay))
```

 

## `select()`

Often you work with large datasets with many columns where only a few are 
actually of interest to you. `select()` allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful
subset using operations that usually only work on numeric variable positions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

You can exclude columns using `-` and specify a range using `:`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```


 

## `distinct()`

A common use of `select()` is to find out which values a set of variables takes.  This is particularly useful in conjunction with the `distinct()` verb which only  returns the unique values in a table.

What do the following data correspond to?

```{r}
distinct(select(flights, origin, dest))
```

 

## `mutate()`

As well as selecting from the set of existing columns, it's often useful to add 
new columns that are functions of existing columns. This is the job of `mutate()`:

```{r}
select(mutate(flights, gain = dep_delay - arr_delay), 
       flight, dep_delay, arr_delay, gain)
```

 

## `summarize()`

`summarize()` collapses a data frame to a single row based on some function. It's not very useful yet, but it will be. 

```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

 
## Practice

**Mutate** the data to create a new column that contains the average speed traveled by the plane for each flight. 

**Select** the new variable and save it, along with tailnum, as a new data frame object.

 
## Practice

**Mutate** the data to create a new column that contains the average speed traveled by the plane for each flight. 

**Select** the new variable and save it, along with tailnum, as a new data frame object.

```{r}
flights2 <- mutate(flights, speed = distance/(air_time/60))
speed_data <- select(flights2, tailnum, speed)
```

 

## `group_by()`

`summarize()` and `sample_n()` are even more powerful when combined with the idea of  "group by", repeating the operation separately on groups of observations within the dataset. 

The `group_by()` function describes how to break a dataset down into groups of rows.

 

## `group_by()`

Find the fastest airplanes in the bunch, measured as the average speed per airplane.

```{r}
by_tailnum <- group_by(speed_data, tailnum)
avg_speed <- summarize(by_tailnum, 
                       count = n(), 
                       avg_speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE))
arrange(avg_speed, desc(avg_speed))
```



## Chaining

Instead of applying each verb step-by-step, we can chain them into a single
data pipeline, connected with the `|> ` operator. You start the pipeline with
a data frame and then pass it to each function in turn.


The pipe syntax (`|> `) takes a data frame and sends it to the argument of a function.  The mapping goes to the first available argument in the function.  For example:

`x |>  f()` is the same as `f(x)`

`x |>  f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`


 

## Mornings

```{r}
#| eval: false
me_step1 <- dress(me, what = sports)  
me_step2 <- exercise(me_step1, how = running)  
me_step3 <- eat(me_step2, choice = cereal)  
me_step4 <- dress(me_step3, what = school)  
me_step5 <- commute(me_step4, transportation = bike)  
```
 

## Mornings

```{r}
#| eval: false
commute(dress(eat(exercise(dress(me, what = sports), how = running), choice = cereal), what = school), transportation = bike)
```

 

## Morning

(better??)

```{r}
#| eval: false
commute(
  dress(
    eat(
      exercise(
        dress(me, 
              what = sports), 
        how = running), 
      choice = cereal), 
    what = school), 
  transportation = bike)
```

 

## Mornings

```{r}
#| eval: false
me |> 
  dress(what = sports) |> 
  exercise(how = running) |> 
  eat(choice = cereal) |> 
  dress(what = school) |> 
  commute(transportation = bike)
```

From Hadley Wickham, how to think about tidy data.

> Little bunny Foo Foo

> Went hopping through the forest

> Scooping up the field mice

> And bopping them on the head

 

## Little Bunny Foo Foo

The nursery rhyme could be created by a series of steps where the output from each step is saved as an object along the way.

```{r}
#| eval: false
foo_foo <- little_bunny()
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_2, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```
 

## Little Bunny Foo Foo

Another approach is to concatenate the functions so that there is only one output.  

```{r}
#| eval: false
bop(
   scoop(
      hop(foo_foo, through = forest),
      up = field_mice),
   on = head)
```
 

## Little Bunny Foo Foo

Or even worse, as one line:

```{r}
#| eval: false
bop(scoop(hop(foo_foo, through = forest), up = field_mice), on = head)))
```
 
## Little Bunny Foo Foo

Instead, the code can be written using the pipe in the **order** in which the function is evaluated:

```{r}
#| eval: false
foo_foo |> 
   hop(through = forest) |> 
       scoop(up = field_mice) |> 
           bop(on = head)
```

## Flights
 
 
::: {.panel-tabset}

## No pipe

```{r}
flights2 <- mutate(flights, speed = distance/(air_time/60))
tail_speed <- select(flights2, tailnum, speed)
tail_speed_grp <- group_by(tail_speed, tailnum)
tail_ave <- summarize(tail_speed_grp, number = n(),
                      avg_speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE))
arrange(tail_ave, desc(avg_speed))
```

## Pipe

```{r}
flights |> 
  mutate(speed = distance / (air_time/60)) |> 
  select(tailnum, speed) |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |>  
  summarize(number = n(), 
            avg_speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_speed))
```

::: 

 

## Practice

Form a chain that creates a data frame containing only carrier and each carrier's mean departure delay time. Which carriers have the highest and lowest mean delays?

 

## Practice

Form a chain that creates a data frame containing only carrier and the mean departure delay time. Which carriers have the highest and lowest mean delays?

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(carrier) |> 
  summarize(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_delay))
```

 

## Practice again

Say you're curious about the relationship between the number of flights that each plane made in 2013, the mean distance that each of those planes flew, and the mean arrival delay. You also want to exclude the edge cases from your analysis, so focus on the planes that have logged more than 20 flights and flown an average distance of less than 2000 miles. Please form the chain that creates this dataset.

 

## Solution

```{r}
delay_data <- flights |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |> 
  summarize(number = n(),
            dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), 
            delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  filter(number > 20, dist < 2000)
```


 

## Visualizing the data

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Viz
```{r eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(delay_data, aes(dist, delay)) +
 geom_point(aes(size = number), alpha = 1/2) +
 geom_smooth() +
 scale_size_area()
```

## Code
```{r eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
delay_data |> 
 ggplot(aes(dist, delay)) +
 geom_point(aes(size = number), 
            alpha = 1/2) +
 geom_smooth() +
 scale_size_area()
```
When `scale_size_area` is used, the default behavior is to scale the area of points to be proportional to the value.
