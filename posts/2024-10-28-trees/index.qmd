## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* What does CART stand for?

* How does CART make predictions on test data?

* Can CART be used for both classification and regression or only one of the two tasks?

* Can you use categorical / character predictors with CART?

* How is tree depth chosen?

* What does it mean for CART to be high variance? 

* What are the advantages of the CART algorithm?

* What are the disadvantages of the CART algorithm?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* What type of feature engineering is required for CART?

* If the model produces near perfect predictions on the test data, what are some potential concerns about putting that model into production?

> With the help of the Rand Corp., the city tried to measure fire response times, identify redundancies in service, and close or re-allocate fire stations accordingly. What resulted, though, was a perfect storm of bad data: The methodology was flawed, the analysis was rife with biases, and the results were interpreted in a way that stacked the deck against poorer neighborhoods. The slower response times allowed smaller fires to rage uncontrolled in the city’s most vulnerable communities.
