## Agenda <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>

### August 28, 2024

2. NSSD

4. ggplot


### September 4, 2024

1. Cholera: what went (didn't go) well with the graphics?
2. Challenger: what didn't go (went) well with the graphics?
3. Thoughts on plotting (with example(s))

* Class discussion will be based on Tufte (1997) <a href = "http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_textb" target = "_blank">Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions</a>.  (Use Google to find it.)

* Another great reference is the following text: **Fundamentals of Data Visualization** by Wilke at http://serialmentor.com/dataviz/

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 

* When creating a graph, try to sketch / image the graph before you code it.  What do you want R to do (what is the goal)?  In order to do that, what does R need to know?

* What should the goal of a plot be?  What should the goal of your plot be?

* What different aspects deconstruct a plot?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* Does your plot make the comparison of interest: easily? and accurately?

* Did you add alt text to your images (see <a href = "https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81" target = "_blank">Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization</a>)?  

* Is your plot accessible to those who are color blind or looking at the image in black and white?
