## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* How and why is `|>` used?  And how is it different from the layering symbol `+` used in `ggplot()`?

* What are the main data wrangling verbs?

* How do you distinguish the different `_join` functions?  Are the `_join` keys formatted in the same way across the two datasets?  Are the data recorded in the same way (e.g., is age birthday or age at recording?) ?

* What are some of the ways to distinguish a data verb from a typical function?



## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* What is Jan 31 plus one month?  And why does it matter that **every** analysis we do is a series of decisions?  Keeping in mind that each of us might make a different decision, and all decisions have consequences.
