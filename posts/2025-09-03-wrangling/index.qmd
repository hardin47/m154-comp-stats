## Agenda <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" target="_blank"></i>

### September 3, 2025

1. Tidy data
2. Data verbs


### ~~September 10, 2025~~ when we need it

1. Relational data (`_join`)
2. `pivot`ing


## Readings <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> 

* Class notes: <a href = "https://st47s.com/Math154/Notes/03-wrangling.html" target= "_blank">Data Wrangling</a>

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* How and why is `|>` used?  And how is it different from the layering symbol `+` used in `ggplot()`?

* What are the main data wrangling verbs?

* How do you distinguish the different `_join` functions?  Are the `_join` keys formatted in the same way across the two datasets?  Are the data recorded in the same way (e.g., is age birthday or age at recording?) ?

* What are some of the ways to distinguish a data verb from a typical function?



## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* What is Jan 31 plus one month?  And why does it matter that **every** analysis we do is a series of decisions?  Keeping in mind that each of us might make a different decision, and all decisions have consequences.
