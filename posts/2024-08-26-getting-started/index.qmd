Before Wednesday, listen to the <a href = "https://nssdeviations.com/71-compromised-shoe-situation" target = "_blank">full conversation</a> of Not So Standard Deviations - Compromised Shoe Situation.

### August 28, 2024 

1. Reproducibility & GitHub
2. <a href = "https://simplystatistics.org/2019/01/09/how-data-scientists-think-a-mini-case-study/" target="_blank">Design Challenge (Not So Standard Deviations)</a>

Before next Thursday, read: Tufte. 1997. <a href = "http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_textb" target = "_blank">Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions</a>.  (Use Google to find it.)

## Readings <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> 

* The [syllabus](/syllabus/)
* **Modern Data Science with R** <a href="https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr3e/01-intro.html" target="_blank">Prologue</a>
* Class notes: <a href = "http://st47s.com/Math154/Notes/intro.html" target= "_blank">Introduction</a>
* <a href = "https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/05/27/github-illustrated-series/" target = "_blank">Why Git? + monsters</a>


## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> 

* What can statistics & data science do?  How do they do that?

* What can't statistics & data science do?  Why not?

* What choices were made to collect the Twitter data?

* What choices were made to model the Twitter data?

* What are the advantages and disadvantages of high touch versus low touch data?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* Why is it problematic if the analysis isn't reproducible?

* Is every analysis worth doing? (e.g., time to get to work, predicting presidential results, etc.).  Can the *act* of doing the analysis be ethically questionable?
