## Agenda <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" target="_blank"></i>

### October 7, 2024

1. Review: logic of confidence intervals
2. Logic of bootstrapping (resample from the sample *with* replacement)
3. BS SE of a statistic



### October 9, 2024

1. Normal CI using BS SE
2. Bootstrap-t (studentized) CIs 
3. Percentile CIs
4. properties / advantages / disadvantages

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* Why would anyone ever want to bootstrap?

* What are the differences between a normal CI with Boot SE, a Bootstrap-t CI, and a percentile interval?

* Why do we need to bootstrap twice for the Bootstrap-t CI?

* What makes a confidence interval procedure good?


## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* Why isn't the bootstrap method a solution for the situation of small sample sizes?

* Why isn't the bootstrap method a solution for the situation with biased / unrepresentative data? 

* Consider a population with a maximum value (the parameter of interest).  Will the sample max have a sampling distribution which is centered on the true maximum?  Why or why not?  [Quintessential example of how a statistic can be biased for the parameter.]
